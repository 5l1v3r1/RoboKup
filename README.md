<h2>:soccer::soccer::soccer:b The Goal of this Simple Script :soccer::soccer::soccer:</h2>


There are several scripts on the internet that do good or badly the same thing, but I decided to optimize some of these scripts so as to make the program compatible with all windows systems.

The Goals are:

- Compatible with all Windows systems (98 to Windows 10)
- Double click to start it on any system (with a ps1 file it would not be possible)
- It recognizes the Windows version by itself and retrieves the folders from the right path
- Copy all the main folders and profiles
- Name the backup folder with the name of the computer and insert today's date
